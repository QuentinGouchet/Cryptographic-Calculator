Cryptographic-Calculator
========================

This is an implementation of a public key cryptographic calculator
The graphic interface has been implemented in C++ but all the crypto code has been coded
with the C programming language.
Download the code, and use qmake to compile.
Then launch src.pro (using Qt is otherwise a very nice option!)
